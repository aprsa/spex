Stellar Population Explorer

This script combines the output from a stellar population code with an eclipsing binary model PHOEBE. It uses the distribution
of orbital periods of binary stars and the distribution of eccentricities inferred from the Kepler data to generate a catalog
of eclipsing binary light curves. This currently serves to create LSST data challenge light curves, but it will be broadened
in the near future to compute the underlying parameter distributions based on observed Kepler/K2/TESS/Gaia/... data.
